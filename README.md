For the NanoLora and Wazidev v1.2 boards to work properly on windows, simply download and install "CH341SER.EXE".

2. *examples* - this folder contains code examples for various use cases with Waziup.

To have all Waziup code examples showing up inside your Arduino examples list.

	-Copy "12.Waziup" and paste inside the examples folder at C:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino\examples
	-Open your Arduino IDE and navigate to Files->Examples->Waziup
